<h1>1. Background</h1>
<p>
This is a document describing http2 from a technical and protocol level. It started out as a presentation I did in Stockholm in April 2014 that was then converted and extended into a full-blown document with all details and proper explanations.
<p>
RFC 7540 is the official name of the final http2 specification and it was published on May 15th 2015: http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7540.txt
<p>
All and any errors in this document are my own and the results of my shortcomings. Please point them out to me and I might do updates with corrections.
<p>
In this document I've tried to consistently use the word "http2" to describe the new protocol while in pure technical terms, the proper name is HTTP/2. I made this choice for the sake of readability and to get a better flow in the language.

  <h2>1.1 Author</h2>
<p>
  My name is Daniel Stenberg and I work for Mozilla. I've been working with open source and networking for over twenty years in numerous projects. Possibly I'm best known for being the lead developer of curl and libcurl. I've been involved in the IETF HTTPbis working group for several years and there I've kept up-to-date with the refreshed HTTP 1.1 work as well as being involved in the http2 standardization work.
